			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Beats Antique was formed in San Francisco, California in 2007 when Zoe Jakes approached her manager, Miles Copeland (brother of drummer Stewart Copeland of The Police) about creating an album. Copeland green lit the project, and their debut album Tribal Derivations was conceived on Copeland’s CIA record label. Tribal Derivations was a concept album, created to complement the dance styles of producer/arranger Zoe Jakes. The group’s second album, Collide, reached the top 10 of most downloaded artists under the Middle East and World Dance and the top 20 most downloaded electronic albums on Amazon. For their third album, Contraption Vol. 1, Beats Antique brought in collaborators such as hammered dulcimer player Jamie Janover, and beat boxer and hip hop vocalist LYNX. Their 2010 release Blind Threshold featured harmonica player John Popper of Blues Traveler. The 10-track Elektraphone was released October 4, 2011 supported by a 26-city tour running from October to December 2011</p>

			<h3>Latest Tour</h3>
			<p>In fall of 2014, Beats Antique toured with Shpongle (Simon Posford DJ Sets), Emancipator, and Lafa Taylor as part of their “Creature Carnival” tour. Featuring carnival-themed performers specific to each city, audience participation, and crafting events surrounding four “Creatures” (Light Saber the tiger, Al Eyes the owl, Jackie Lope the Antelope, and Squidzilla the squid), attendees of the shows were encouraged to dress wildly and come prepared with customized Creature masks. </p>

			<h3>A thousand Faces</h3>
			<p>To build the lavish and intricate soundscapes heard throughout A Thousand Faces, Beats Antique blended the hypnotic rhythms and elegant melodies of traditional music with deftly crafted beats that reveal their affinity with EDM culture. An internationally regarded belly dancer who’s heading up the choreography for the dance element of the Thousand Faces tour, Jakes notes that she also found much inspiration in classical Indian dance and its practice of using movement as a means of storytelling. For help in lacing together so many eclectic sounds and influences, Beats Antique recruited guest musicians like baritone sax and clarinet player Sylvain Carton and violinist Lila Sklar, in addition to Les Claypool (who lends his bass wizardry and vocals to the brilliantly twisted “Beelzebub”) and singer/songwriter/beat-boxer LYNX (who appears on the breathtakingly ethereal “You the Starry Eyed”). From the serpentine splendor of “Pandora’s Box” to the heady intensity of “Veil of Tears,” the result is epic in scope yet intimate in its emotionalism. </p>

			<h3>Collide</h3>
			<p>Collide came to life after Beats Antique enlisted their fans for what would be a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign to fund their most ambitious stage production to date. After overwhelming support, Beats Antique were able to call upon the incredible talents of Creative Director Ivan Landau (Aeon Flux, Sin City, Blade Runner) and Obscura Digital, the acclaimed live art projections company whose resume includes projects with the Guggenheim and the royalty of Dubai, to produce a truly unique and technically groundbreaking performance art experience traveling through each track of the two volume musical journey that’s part odyssey and part genre-warping rock opera.  </p>
