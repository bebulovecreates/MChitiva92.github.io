<h1><strong>Artist Statement</strong></h1>
<br>
<h5>As an artist I try and capture the things that make us sacred, and give us light. 
Based from miami my influences began through nature and the connections that we make with this life
Wether it is spiritual or physical, life is beautiful collage of moments.
My work reflects on the thoughts and connections our eyes can make.
Namaste,
<strong>Bebulove</strong>
