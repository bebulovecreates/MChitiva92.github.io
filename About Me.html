<h1><strong>Artist Statement</strong></h1>
<br>
<h5>As an artist I try and capture the things that make us sacred, and give us light. 
<br>
Based from miami my influences began through nature and the connections that we make with this life
<br>
Wether it is spiritual or physical, life is a beautiful collage of moments.
<br>
My work reflects on the thoughts and connections our eyes can make.

<br><br>
Namaste,
<br>
